## Basics

* `<b>` and `<i>` are explicit meaning they specify bold and italic respectively whereas `<strong>` and `<em>` are semantic. They specify that the enclosed text should be "strong" or "emphasised" in some way, usually bold and italic, but allow for the actual styling to be controlled via CSS. Hence these are preferred in modern web pages.
* Three kinds of lists: `Unordered`, `Ordered` and `Definition`.
* Inline Elements: `<q>` (to put quotes), `<b>`, `<i>`, `<em>` and `<strong>`. These are usually wrapped around phrases of text.
* Block-Level Elements: `<blockquote>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>` etc. They start a new block.
* The `<time>` element with its `datetime` attribute is how date & time are communicated so that browsers can display the proper date & time.
* `<pre>` element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. If you don't want the intentional spacing or new lines by HTML, this is the tag to be used.
* `<sub>` and `<sup>` represent the subscript and superscript.
* `<small>` can be used to convey something that has very little prominence (like a copyright).
